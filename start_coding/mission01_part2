### “Reality Check” worksheet
* Money:  
  * I can spend $0 over the next 12 months. My workplace won't give any money for this and I think that python training don't need to cost anything.
* Time:
  * I can devote at least 7 hours a week to learning, for a total of 300 hours this year.
* Other:  
  * I know that I need to account for my family needs and work hours, also, I've started running and swimming 3-4 times a week and I'm cutting on those hours. that might be challenging for me.   
  * I’m going to do my best to address these needs by making sure I've devoted parts of my schedule to those activities.
