“Reality Check”

Big goals are great! But once in awhile, we need to do a reality check. Let’s examine the constraints you need to consider to create your learn-to-code curriculum. 

Money:
How much can you invest in your learning in the next six months? Twelve months?
Do you already have that money available? If not, do you plan to borrow it, apply for scholarships, something else?  
If you’re employed, could your employer help support you in your pursuit of technical skills? Some employers provide professional development funding, or they’ll fund attendance at conferences and professional association events. If you’re not sure, ask!
If money is a concern, are there expenses you can cut back on to use for educational resources, meetups, conferences, etc.? Are there grants or scholarships you know of that might help you on your lean-to-code journey?

Tally up your resources.
I can spend _________________ over the next _____________(period of time).

Time:
In the next year, how much time do you have to learn? Do you have a deadline of when you need to “finish” learning?
Are you considering a full-time coding program? How long are the programs that interest you? How long could you survive on other resources while job-hunting after the program if you don’t land a job right away?
What activities are you willing to you put off, delegate, or replace in order to make time for coding?

I can devote at least ______ hours/weekends/months to learning, for a total of ____________ hours/weekends/months this year.


Other:
What are other things that might affect your learn-to-code journey: Location, physical ability, healthy, family responsibilities, etc.?

When I’m totally honest with myself, I know that I need to account for ___________________________________________________________________
	that might be challenging for me. 

I’m going to do my best to address these needs by __________________________________________________________.
