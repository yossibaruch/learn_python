## Fill out my worksheet and send it to cnc2018@codenewbie.org
### Start Coding worksheet
* Why are you learning to code?
  * I want to start coding because
    * Coding is a must in life, you won't be able to do anything in the future without this knowledge. Also, I work in IT & Cyber and this knowledge will really help me with what I do, not to mention that I really enjoy coding.
* What’s your goal?
  * What’s a tangible learn-to-code goal you hope to reach in 6 months?
    * Become fluent in writing python code, not stopping on each step
    * Start thinking that python is a solution to everything (and when it's not - use other languages), now I'm not starting with going to find a coding solution but try to find an open source one.
  * 12 months?
    * Same, just adding some open source projects to my portfolio, stop being afraid to participate.
* What does successful learning look like to you?
  * Is it about building a bunch of projects, having a deeper understanding of a particular technology, passing a certification, something else? Visualize and write down what success looks like to you.
    * I think that successful learning is leading to using what was learned in life. This only happens when practicing and integrating what was learned into your work and efforts.    
* How will you measure that success?
  * Is it about the amount of time spent, badges collected, courses complete? Are there tools to use to track your learning so that you can measure your progress and document your success?
    * If every time I'll have to solve something in work/life I'll think "is python the answer?" it's a success story.
* Do you have a timeline, or any deadlines, associated with your learning goals?
  * Do you need to pass an exam by a certain day? Do you need to start applying for jobs by a certain time? Do want to finish a project on a particular date? Jot down any due dates or important time related criteria.
    * No timeline, I'm actually using python now in my work, just not in the scale I need and want.
