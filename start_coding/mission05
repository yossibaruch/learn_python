# Mission 5 - Coding Session #2 - send to cnc2018@codenewbie.org
## How do you feel about the primary resource you’ve been using?
* Are they catering to your learning style enough to stick with it? It’s important to note that learning resources aren’t perfect, and you don’t want to keep trying so many resources that you don’t finish anything, but if a resource is more frustrating than it is valuable, it’s time to consider a different option. Jot down your thoughts here:
## Do you have a way of getting unstuck?
* In these early days of learning to code, it’s easy to give up when you have a wall and you just can’t break through. Have you hit any walls yet? How’ve you handled those? Do you need to find dedicated solutions to help you get unstuck? Invest some time in finding online resources to help you solve this problem in the future. Jot down how you’ll get unstuck here:
## Is there a particular concept that just isn’t making sense to you?
* It might be time to look at your other resources and see if there are supplementary resources you can use to help fill your knowledge gaps. Jot down the topics that have been giving you a hard time, and how you plan on getting those questions answered:
## How have your coding sessions tied back to your learn-to-code goals?
* This is a good moment to check in and see that all the learning you’re doing still connects back to your original goals for starting in the first place. If there’s a disconnect there, is it because you need to adjust your learning, or your goals? Take a moment to reflect and make adjustments as needed.
