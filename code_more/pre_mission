## What has worked?
* My code is becoming more complicated, and I feel more sure about the stuff I do.
* I'm using different modules and learning how to use exceptions, this is one area that has been a blur to me.
* I'm becoming python aware, finding areas where I can solve challenges with python coding.
### Why was is a happy session?
* Solved stuff on my own.
* Learned how to use before unknown modules (to me).
* Felt a step up in my knowledge, thinking on how to code in my mind.   
## What has NOT worked?
* It's hard for me to handle errors and exceptions, can't seem to find a flow.
* I'm writing in pycharms but usually run my code on linux servers, which adds a second step of debugging my code.
* I feel that I'm fighting windmills sometimes, trying really hard to do something one way and then figuring out that there is a better (easier) solution.
### Why those unhappy things happen?
* I haven't find yet a way to handle exceptions in a methodical fashion
* It's hard to get used to 2 steps of checking stuff, python 2 and 3 are installed on different machines that we're handling
* I haven't found the exact method to work on code, to plan stuff ahead 
## What are my short-term goals?
* Become fluent in writing python code, not stopping on each step
* Start thinking that python is a solution to everything (and when it's not - use other languages), now I'm not starting with going to find a coding solution but try to find an open source one.
## What are my long-term goals?
* Same, just adding some open source projects to my portfolio, stop being afraid to participate.
